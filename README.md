Does this really needs a readme file? Why even bother opening it, you must bo so dumb, the program is so easy to use even my grandma doesnt need instructions. But why creating it the first time? Im just asked to add it by Github, do I really need to follow their instructions? I had the choice to not do it but I still did it.. why are we here? just to suffer. I really gotta go study instead of writing this lame ass programs with useless READMEs probably no one will ever need, but hey youre here!
